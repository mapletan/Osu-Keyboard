# Osu-Keyboard

This code maps two keys of the keyboard to two buttons connected to an Adafruit Trinket microcontroller. I made this for a game called osu!, a rhythm game where you must hit the buttons as the hit circle shrinks. Many people play this with a tablet and two keys on the keyboard.

## Getting Started

- You'll need the [Adafruit Trinket](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1501)
- The [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) if you would like to modify the keys 
- Soldering iron
- Wires
- Keyboard switches

## Wiring

You must wire and solder with the connections shown, putting the switches in place of the buttons.

## Using the keyboard

After soldering together and housing it in a case, you may use a micro-usb cable to plug it in your computer. Opening up the Arduino file in the IDE, you must verify and upload the code onto the microcontroller. After this is done, your keyboard is complete!
